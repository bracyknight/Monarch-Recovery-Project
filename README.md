Monarch Costs Analysis

This project is designed to assist in planning for a national-scale monarch butterfly recovery project. The R code here is designed to build upon Thogmartin et al's (2017) "All Hands on Deck" paper by affixing costs to various recovery strategies. Costs per acre were determined through a combination of pricing research through vendors, interviews, and a survey of conservation practicitioners.
